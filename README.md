# Diabetic-EyeNet-CNN-based-Diabetic-Retinopathy-DR-Detection


## Problem Statement

**Diabetic retinopathy (DR)** is a leading cause of blindness among individuals with diabetes, characterized by progressive damage to the retina due to prolonged high blood sugar levels. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial to prevent severe vision loss and manage the disease effectively. Traditional diagnostic methods rely heavily on manual examination of retinal images by ophthalmologists, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error.

This project aims to develop an automated system for detecting and classifying diabetic retinopathy using deep learning techniques. By employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the goal is to create a model that can accurately categorize retinal images into different stages of diabetic retinopathy.

## Data

The dataset used for this project consists of retinal images with associated labels indicating the severity of Diabetic Retinopathy. The images have been processed to a consistent size and format for model training.

**Objectives:**
* **Data Preprocessing**: Implement a pipeline to handle and prepare retinal images for model training, including image resizing and normalization.
* **Model Development**: Design and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify retinal images based on the severity of diabetic retinopathy.
* **Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the trained model on a separate test dataset to ensure its accuracy and reliability in predicting diabetic retinopathy.
  
**Scope:**
The project includes data handling and preprocessing, model architecture design, training, and evaluation.
The model will be tested on a dataset consisting of retinal images with various levels of diabetic retinopathy severity.
Results will be analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the model in assisting healthcare professionals with DR diagnosis.
By automating the DR detection process, this project aims to support early intervention and improve diagnostic accuracy, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.
